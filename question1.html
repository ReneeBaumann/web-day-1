<h1>Stop by Sam Brown</h1>
<h2>Verse 1:</h2>
<h4>All that I have is all that you've given me<br>
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you<br>
I gave you all the love I had in me<br>
Now I find you've lied and I can't believe it's true<br>
<img src="./img.liar.jpeg" alt="Liar">
Wrapped in her arms I see you across the street<br>
And I can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on<br>
You talk of love but you don't know how it feels<br>
When you realize that you're not the only one<br></h4>

<h2>Chorus:</h2>
<ul>
<h4><li>You'd better stop before you tear me all apart<br></li> 
    <img src="./img.STOP.jpeg" alt="Stop sign">
<li>You'd better stop before you go and break my heart<br></li> 
<li>Ooh you'd better stop<br></li> </h4>
</ul>

<h2>Verse 2:</h2>
<h4>Time after time I've tried to walk away<br>
(I've tried to walk away)<br>
But it's not that easy when your soul is torn in two<br>
So I just resign myself to it every day<br>
Now all I can do is to leave it up to you<br></h4>

<h2>Chorus:</h2>
<ul>
<h4><li>Oh, oh you'd better stop before you tear me all apart<br></li>
<li>You'd better stop before you go and break my heart<br></li>

<li>Ooh you'd better stop if love me (you will remember)<br></li></h4>
</ul>

<h2>Bridge:</h2>
<h4>Now's the time to be sorry (that day forever)<br>
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me, babe ooh<br></h4>

    <img src="./img.tearingmeapart.jpeg" alt="Your tearing me apart Lisa">
You'd better stop (stop) before you go and break my heart<br>
Ooh (you'd better) you'd better stop, babe stop<br>
(You'd better) ooh you'd better stop, babe stop<br>
(You'd better) Babe stop<br>
Babe stop<br></h4>
